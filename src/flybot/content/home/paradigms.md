# Functional Programming

We use the Data Oriented Programming (DOP) and functional programming (FP) paradigms to implement our diverse projects.

Indeed Clojure supports and relies on both of these concepts.

DOP evolves around the idiom 'Everything as data'. It is about building abstraction around basic data structures (list, maps, vectors etc.).
         
You can view both DOP and FP as opposition to Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
